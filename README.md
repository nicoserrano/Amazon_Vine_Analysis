# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
#### *Analysis on Amazon's Vine review program using AWS cloud storage and PySpark*

## Overview

In this project I used *US Apparel product reviews* from Amazon. The goal was to analyze if it would be worth it to subscribe to a Vine program if we were to sell similar products through their platform. The vine review program is an incentive model in which customers are gifted free stuff when they write good reviews.
